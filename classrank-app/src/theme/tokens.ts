/**
 * Steth design tokens.
 *
 * Design direction: the app's subject is climbing a rank — competing,
 * rising, crossing thresholds. The signature element (PulseRing, see
 * components/animated/PulseRing.tsx) is a circular progress ring that fills
 * as you climb and bursts on a threshold crossing. Home's hero is a dark
 * "arena" surface — your stats displayed like a scoreboard under stadium
 * lights — contrasted with a calm, light body below. That contrast is the
 * structural idea everything else is built around; keep it, don't dilute it
 * by making every screen dark or every screen light.
 *
 * Points and rank deliberately have different accent colors (teal vs.
 * violet) so the two concepts stay visually distinct at a glance — this
 * matters because the whole fairness pitch of the app is "points and rank
 * aren't the same thing across departments."
